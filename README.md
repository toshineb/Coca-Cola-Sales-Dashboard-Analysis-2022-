## 📌 Project Description

This project features an interactive **Coca-Cola Sales Dashboard** that showcases end-to-end data analysis and storytelling using **Power BI**. The dashboard is designed to enable **data-driven decision-making** across Coca-Cola's product portfolio, helping stakeholders quickly understand where the company is winning — and where there is room for strategic improvement.

> 🔍 As seen in the image above, this dashboard isn't just about data visualization — it's about extracting **actionable business insights**.

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Real Business Scenario**: Based on Coca-Cola's U.S. beverage sales between *April 28, 2022 – December 25, 2022*.
- **Strategic Insights**: Highlights the **top-performing beverage brands** and **regions by sales volume**, helping inform marketing, distribution, and product strategy.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Uses AI-powered **key influencers analysis** to determine what factors drive **operating profit**.
- **State-Level Visualization**: The **Sales by US State** map visually communicates regional performance using bubble size as an intuitive sales indicator.
- **Executive-Ready Design**: Clean, bold layout using consistent branding and clear KPIs.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways from the Dashboard

- **Coca-Cola Classic** is the strongest performer in both **total sales** (1.45M) and **operating profit** ($582,447).
- **Dasani Water** also drives significant profitability, revealing bottled water's role in Coca-Cola’s earnings mix.
- **Geographical Strength**: Southern and coastal states show higher sales density, offering targets for marketing and supply chain optimization.
- **Average Pricing Insights**: Despite a lower unit price, brands like **Sprite** and **Diet Coke** perform well due to high volume, informing pricing strategy.
